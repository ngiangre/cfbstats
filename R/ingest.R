# ---- NFL outcomes via nflverse (decision 0014) ------------------------------
# These pull post-draft NFL data from nflverse (nflreadr), *not* CFBD, so they
# take no API key. They are linked to CFBD picks by draft slot, never by the
# CFBD `nflAthleteId` (a different id namespace; decision 0014).

#' Ingest NFL draft picks (nflverse)
#'
#' Pulls nflverse's draft-pick table (`nflreadr::load_draft_picks()`). This is
#' the **bridge** from CFBD `picks` to nflverse player ids (`gsis_id`,
#' `pfr_player_id`) *and* a Pro-Football-Reference **career summary**: games,
#' seasons started, last active season (`to`), career box-score totals, and
#' Pro Bowl / All-Pro / Hall-of-Fame flags. Linked to CFBD `picks` by draft slot
#' — `(year, round, overall)` == `(season, round, pick)` — the reliable key,
#' since CFBD `nflAthleteId` is a different namespace (0/4350 recent picks match
#' nflverse `espn_id`) and name-only matching is collision-prone (decision 0014).
#'
#' @param seasons Integer vector of draft seasons (default 2010:2026).

#' Ingest NFL rosters (nflverse)
#'

#' the primary longevity measure — **distinct NFL seasons on a roster** — which,
