#' Attach the draft outcome
#'
#' Marks each player-season with whether that athlete was ever drafted and, if

#' (decision 0003). Outcome definition is refined in the features/model stages
#' (draft-eligible seasons only; out-of-time framing).
#'
#' `picks` carries the full NFL draft history (back to 1936) and CFBD reuses
#' `collegeAthleteId` across eras, so a modern player's id can match a pick from
#' decades earlier. Left unchecked that fans out the join (duplicating a
#' player-season) and falsely attributes an ancient draft to a current player
#' (decision 0011). Since a 2010-2026 college career can only lead to a
#' 2010-2027 draft, picks outside `draft_window` are dropped before the join —
#' this removes the pre-window collision artifacts entirely. The lookup is then
#' collapsed to **one pick per `playerId`** (most recent, a guard against any
#' future intra-window collision), so the join is strictly 1:1 on `playerId`,
#' adds no rows, and marks `drafted` only for a plausible in-window pick.
#'
#' @param player_season Player-season backbone.
#' @param picks Cleaned picks from [clean_picks()].

#' Attach name-guarded high-school recruiting ratings
#'

#' (decision 0013) — e.g. Cam Ward's id maps to a different recruit, Xavier Ward
#' — so a rating is trusted only when the recruiting name agrees with the
#' backbone `player` name after [normalize_name()]. Ratings from a

#' Bridge CFBD picks to nflverse ids and NFL outcomes
#'
#' Attaches nflverse player ids and headline NFL-career outcomes to CFBD `picks`
#' by **draft slot** — CFBD `(year, round, overall)` == nflverse
#' `(season, round, pick)`. This is the reliable bridge: CFBD `nflAthleteId` is a
#' different id namespace (0 of 4,350 recent picks match nflverse `espn_id`) and
#' name-only matching is collision-prone, whereas the slot join matched
#' 4,350/4,350 recent picks (99.7% carrying a `pfr_player_id`); decision 0014.
#'
#' A [normalize_name()] guard (as in [link_recruiting()], decision 0013) nulls
#' the attached ids/outcomes whenever the CFBD and PFR names disagree, flagged by
#' `nfl_matched`; benign suffix/nickname differences (Will Anderson Jr. ↔ Will
#' Anderson) pass. The nflverse table is unique per slot, so the join is
#' many-to-one and never inflates `picks`. Picks outside the nflverse window
#' (e.g. pre-2010) simply find no slot and stay unmatched.
#'
#' Longevity note (decision 0014): `nfl_to` (last active NFL season) and
#' `nfl_games` are **right-censored** for recent draft classes still active —
#' treat them as "≥" outcomes, not completed careers.
