# Features: longitudinal (career-sequence) change features (decision 0003).
# Each player's seasons are linked chronologically by athlete id and lag/delta
# features are attached to the player-season row. Lags may only use prior-season
# data (no leakage from the predicted draft class); the model stage enforces the
# out-of-time split.

#' Add between-season change features
#'
#' Sorts each athlete's seasons chronologically and derives:
#' - `transferred` — team differs from prior season;
#' - `transfer_direction` — `up` / `lateral` / `down` from the tier delta;
#' - `hc_changed` — head coach differs from prior season;
#' - `followed_coach` — same head coach as prior season *and* transferred.
#'
#' Requires the tier and coach columns already attached
#' ([link_tiers()], [link_coaches()]).
#'
#' @param player_season Player-season table with `team`, `tier`, `coach_id`.
#'
#' @return `player_season` with the change features and prior-season lags added.

#' Attach roster weight
#'
#' Joins the player's listed roster weight by athlete id and season.
#'
#' Note (decision 0003 Outcome): the CFBD `/roster` endpoint reports a **static**
#' weight per player — repeated across every season, with no year-over-year
#' variation (0 of ~44k multi-season players show any change). A between-season
#' `weight_delta` is therefore not derivable from this source, so we keep the
#' static physical attribute only. A career-span change (e.g. recruiting vs.
#' draft weight) would need a different source.
#'
#' @param player_season Player-season table keyed by `playerId`, `season`.
#' @param roster Cleaned roster from [clean_roster()] (must include `weight`).
#'
#' @return `player_season` with the static roster `weight` attached.
